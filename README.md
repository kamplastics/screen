# Screen
The screen on the shop floor. This is running on a localhost.  

## What This Application Does
This application will take a bmp file and display it on a screen somewhere else within the minute.
This allows for a remote virtural whiteboard using paint.
Very good for an office to communicate with a shop floor.

## Setup

Clone this repo to your php directory. You will need SAMBA or some other program allowing the end users to access the image.
Create in this a folder called images. In that folder place a bmp file. (Just 1 bmp file)

When you change the bmp file. It will be given a name of random numbers and letters and it will display on another screen that is correctly visited to the url of this application.
